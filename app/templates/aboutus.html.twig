        <p class="about-intro">
            This system was built to collect, store, and analyse telemetry data from remote devices
            in a reliable and user-friendly way. It allows authenticated users to monitor device status,
            view message logs, and understand how their devices are performing over time.

            <h3>Technical overview</h3>
            <p>
                The application is built using <strong>Slim PHP</strong>, <strong>Twig templates</strong>, and a
                <strong>MySQL</strong> database. Device data is posted to the <code>/api/telemetry</code> endpoint
                and stored in the <code>messages</code> table. The web interface lets users log in and explore that data.
            </p>
